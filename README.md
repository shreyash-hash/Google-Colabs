Here, I have used Random Forest Classifier Machine Learning algorithm for this classification.

### What is Random Forest Classifier in Machine Learning?
Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (for classification) or mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees.

It is an ensemble learning method, which means it combines the predictions of several base estimators (decision trees) to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
